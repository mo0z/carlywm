About
-----

A simple dynamic tiling window manager that can also float windows (and can do both at the same time, actually). It's better to see how it works than to read about it, so watch the video:

I run it with a simple status bar (as seen in screenshots), [lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar), and [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh) for setting a background.

Extended Window Manager Hints
-----------------------------

This is *kinda* there, at this point. Enough to feed the number of workspaces and the current workspace to a status bar or whatever you want. It also should recognize transient windows, such as an application launcher like [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi).
